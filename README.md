# wpAngular

This is my first project using AngularJS. I was looking for a playfull way of discovering AngularJS. 
I thought displaying my WordPress blog using REST API should do the trick. 
Using Bootstrap helped a lot to have a good looking website quickly.

## Framework/API
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* WordPress REST API

## Concepts in action
